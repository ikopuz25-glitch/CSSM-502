# First, I defined a random list and a target value.  

import math 
my_list = [2, 3, 5, 7,19, 23, 45, 56, 72, 87, 103]
         
target_value= 19

# I defined my_index with the index function which will store the index of target_value in my_list. 
my_index= my_list.index (target_value)

# I asked for inputs. 
input_a = input()
input_a = int(input_a)

# Then I wrote an if statement which will return the index of the target_value if it is equal to the given input_a.

if input_a== target_value:
    print (my_index)
    
# Then I wrote an else statement where I put an another index function(?) index_value that 
# will store the value of the index where the i'th number in my_list that entered the for loop. 
# While the for loop checking each index j= my_list[i] to be greater than the
# input, index_value stores where the input would be if it were inserted in the list. 
# When it comes to an index that is greater than itself the loop stops and it returns the value. 
# This is only possible because the list is already ordered. 
# The code worked for numbers less than 2 but it was not working for integeres greater than the last index 
# I tried some solutions but they broke the other parts so I wrote a practical elif line for that. 
# When the input is one of the numbers in the list, it gives the already existed index.  

else:  
      for i in range(len(my_list)): 
          j= my_list[i]
