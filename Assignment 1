# Question 1

 
my_list=[1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20]

print("Choose a number from 1 to 20")
input_a =  input()
input_a = int(input_a)

###I tried to write a math function here which will give a random number from the set obv it is not completely random  
digit= len(str(input_a))

for b  in range (2,5,8):
    t= (digit * (b-1)) + 3
  

#print (my_list[t])

if input_a== my_list[t]:
    print("Correct")
elif input_a < my_list[t]: 
    print ("Higher")
else: 
    print ("Lower")



# Question 2

# First, I defined a random list and a target value.  
# I defined my_index with the index function which will store the index of target_value in my_list. 
# I asked for inputs. 
# Then I wrote an if statement which will return the index of the target_value if it is equal to the given input_a.
# Then I wrote an else statement where I put an another index function(?) index_value that 
# will store the value of the index where the i'th number in my_list that entered the for loop. 
# While the for loop checking each index j= my_list[i] to be greater than the
# input, index_value stores where the input would be if it were inserted in the list. 
# When it comes to an index that is greater than itself the loop stops and it returns the value. 
# This is only possible because the list is already ordered. 
# The code worked for numbers less than 2 but it was not working for integeres greater than the last index 
# I tried some solutions but they broke the other parts so I wrote a practical elif line for that. 
# When the input is one of the numbers in the list, it gives the already existed index. 

my_list = [2, 3, 5, 7,19, 23, 45, 56, 72, 87, 103]
         
target_value= 19
my_index= my_list.index (target_value)

input_a = input()
input_a = int(input_a)


if input_a== target_value:
    print (my_index)
else:  
      for i in range(len(my_list)): 
          j= my_list[i]
          index_value= my_list.index(j)
          
          if input_a <= j:
              print (index_value)
              break


          elif input_a > 103:
              print (11)
              break 

          
##Question 3 

#First, I took binary numbers in inputs as strings, so that I an count their digits. 
### I create a list with the string versions of them 
# I store the values of their digit numbers with the len fuction in digit_1 and digit_2
#I wrote a function and descrbied the first and second indexes of the set my_list respectively as 
# bin_1 and bin_2. At this point bin_1 and bin_2 are strings. 
#Now, I define two integers, int_1 and int_2. And a dummy variable "power" to use as powers of 2. 
#In this for loop, I tried to write a binomial expansion, range has to be digit_1-1. 
#Because expansion starts from 0 and goes to n-1,counting n. 
#The index(i) also starts from 0 so to make them equal it has to be digit_1-1.
#To be honest I didn't properly understand the logic of why it goes reverse, I tried with +1 it didnt worked. 
# Each for loop we add 1 to the power so the expansion continues, 
# When the loop finished for int_1 we have to redescribed power as 0 for int_2. 

bin_1= input()
bin_2= input()
bin_1= str(bin_1)
bin_2= str(bin_2)

my_list= [bin_1, bin_2]

digit_1= len(str(bin_1))
digit_2= len(str(bin_2))


def bin_to_int (my_list):
    bin_1 = my_list[0]
    bin_2 = my_list[1]
      
    int_1=0 
    int_2=0 
    power=0
    
    for i in range(digit_1-1, -1, -1): 
        
        int_1= int_1 + int(bin_1[i]) * pow(2,power)
        power= power + 1
        
    power= 0
    
    for i in range(digit_2 -1, -1, -1):  
        
        int_2= int_2 + int(bin_2[i]) * pow(2,power)
        power= power + 1
 
    sum= int_1 + int_2 
    
    return sum

#Question 4

sample_list = [1,1,3,3,4,4,5,7,7,9,9]

# Question 5
dna = input()
splits = []

# I split the dna string to 10 letter substrings. 
for i in range (len(dna)): 
    dna_list= (dna[i:i+10])
    splits.append(dna_list)
    print(dna_list)

# So here it checks every element of the set whether they are the same,
#there was need for nested loops because when I only controlled the consecutives they are all distinct.
# I tried different things with the ranges this one also worked.j can starts from the end, i from the 0 and they can meet at the middle of the list also. 
# But with different sequences it does not work sometimes. 

for i in range(j): 
    for j in range (i+1, len(splits)):
        if splits[i] == splits[j]:
            
            print (splits[i])
