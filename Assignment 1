# Question 2

# First, I defined a random list and a target value.  
# I defined my_index with the index function which will store the index of target_value in my_list. 
# I asked for inputs. 
# Then I wrote an if statement which will return the index of the target_value if it is equal to the given input_a.
# Then I wrote an else statement where I put an another index function(?) index_value that 
# will store the value of the index where the i'th number in my_list that entered the for loop. 
# While the for loop checking each index j= my_list[i] to be greater than the
# input, index_value stores where the input would be if it were inserted in the list. 
# When it comes to an index that is greater than itself the loop stops and it returns the value. 
# This is only possible because the list is already ordered. 
# The code worked for numbers less than 2 but it was not working for integeres greater than the last index 
# I tried some solutions but they broke the other parts so I wrote a practical elif line for that. 
# When the input is one of the numbers in the list, it gives the already existed index. 

my_list = [2, 3, 5, 7,19, 23, 45, 56, 72, 87, 103]
         
target_value= 19
my_index= my_list.index (target_value)

input_a = input()
input_a = int(input_a)


if input_a== target_value:
    print (my_index)
else:  
      for i in range(len(my_list)): 
          j= my_list[i]
          index_value= my_list.index(j)
          
          if input_a <= j:
              print (index_value)
              break


          elif input_a > 103:
              print (11)
              break 

          
##Question 3 

#First, I took binary numbers in inputs as strings, so that I an count their digits. 
### I create a list with the string versions of them 
# I store the values of their digit numbers with the len fuction in digit_1 and digit_2
#I wrote a function and descrbied the first and second indexes of the set my_list respectively as 
# bin_1 and bin_2. At this point bin_1 and bin_2 are strings. 
#Now, I define two integers, int_1 and int_2. And a dummy variable "power" to use as powers of 2. 
#In this for loop, I tried to write a binomial expansion, range has to be digit_1-1. 
#Because expansion starts from 0 and goes to n-1,counting n. 
#The index(i) also starts from 0 so to make them equal it has to be digit_1-1.
#To be honest I didn't properly understand the logic of why it goes reverse, I tried with +1 it didnt worked. 
# Each for loop we add 1 to the power so the expansion continues, 
# When the loop finished for int_1 we have to redescribed power as 0 for int_2. 

bin_1= input()
bin_2= input()
bin_1= str(bin_1)
bin_2= str(bin_2)
